# 5 antenna problem
In 5 antenna problem we have to place 5 antennas (a, b, c, d, e) on a 6x6 grid in such a way that maximum area is covered by their signals. To find the best solution we use Genetic Algorithm, upon a population of twenty random individuals/chromosomes.

## Chromosome:
The chromosome has 5 values, each representing the position of antenna (a,b,c,d,e) consecutively, on the grid. For example, the below chromosome shows the positions of a,b,c,d,e as shown. x is horizontal, and y is vertical. Area covered by each antenna is represented by 1. Similarly uncovered area is represented by 0.
